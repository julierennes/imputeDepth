# imputeDepth
Nonparametric imputation by data depth

Current folder contains the sources of R-package 'imputeDepth' and files required to reproduce all the experiments and data-connected figures of the manuscript 'Nonparametric imputation by data depth' (2017) by Pavlo Mozharovskyi, Julis Josse, and Francois Husson. Detail descriptions for utilization of the files follow.

 - Folder 'imputeDepth' as well as the archive 'imputeDepth_0.1.0.tar.gz' contain sources of the R-package 'imputeDepth', whose functions implement the imputation methods from the manuscript, and which are used in the experiments.

- Folder 'data' contains files of the data sets 'banknotes.dat', 'bloodtransfusion_gp.dat', , 'glass.dat', 'pima.dat'; see the manuscript and references therein for details.

- File 'impute.functions.R' contains routines for competing imputation methods implemented by the authors and a function for introducing missing data into a complete data set.

- Files 'exp.impute.*.R' contain R-sources of the experiments, namely:

 -- files 'exp.impute.StudentT_MCAR.R', 'exp.impute.StudentToutl_MCAR.R', 'exp.impute.StudentT_MAR.R', 'exp.impute.lowrank.R' contain scripts for simulation experiments with missing completely at random (MCAR), MCAR with outliers, missing at random (MAR), lowrank models, respectively, see Section 5.2.
 
 -- files 'exp.impute.banknotes.R', 'exp.impute.bloodtransfusion.R', 'exp.impute.glass.R', 'exp.impute.pima.R' contain scripts for real-data experiments; see Section 5.3. The data sets are supposed to be in the folder 'data', if not the path in the R-file should be changed accordingly.
 
 -- file 'exp.impute.quantile.R' contains the R-script for reproducing the quantile experiment for multiple imputation; see Section 6.1.
 
 -- file 'exp.impute.multiple.R' contains the R-script for reproducing the complete multiple imputation experiment for two regression models, see Section 6.2.

- Files 'plot.intro.R', 'plot.one.density.R', 'plot3d.optim.R' reproduce Figures 1 and 2 (Section 1.1), Figure 3 (Section 3.2), Figure 4 (Section 3.3), respectively.

- Files 'plot3d.realdata.R' produces pairs() and pairs3d() plots used to get intuition by visualizing the real data.
